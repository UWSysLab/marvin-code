# Marvin App and Experiment Code

This repository contains the apps and scripts that were used to test and
evaluate Marvin. The `apps` directory contains Android apps developed in
Android Studio, and `scripts` holds data-processing and graphing scripts. Most
of the other directories contain C++ programs that were used for various things.

[This Google Doc][experiment-descriptions] describes the correspondence between
the code in this repo and the experiments presented in the Marvin paper.
